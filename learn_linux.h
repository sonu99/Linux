1> start with notes.
Q>---> what is os.
Ans:        1> os will allocate the resource in efficient manaer, so it will helps to do multi tasking, multi processing,
            2> os will security to process
           -> each process will run at seprate virtual space.
           -> and other process can't touch it. for doing that we can use IPC.
           
Q> multi tasking, multiprocessing, multi thereading.

Q> ---> diffrent between linux os and RTOS
Ans:               
          -> task should done at fixed time...(quality at fixed time)
          -> (focus on multitasking)
Q---> How we can make RTOS and RT linux
Ans--?
---> what is user sapce.
Ans:-
           ---> what is kernel space 
           ---> why os divided in user and kernel space.
Q---> how to jump user space to kernel space.
Ans:-
------------------------------------------------------------------Process manager--------------------------------------------
